# Personal Assistant
This has been my personal assistant during almost a year.
I am not using it anymore because I moved from Google Apps to Microsoft Business at work and I haven't invested time in migrating it to support Microsoft's suite (not sure if it can be done either because of security policies at work).

## Status
Proof of concept that worked just enough for my usecases. I used it for a long period without any issues. Many improvements can be done.

## What does it do?
- Checks your email and events periodically.
- Gives you a quick recap on unread emails when coming back from inactivity.
- Notifies you of an upcoming event in your calendar.
- All "notifications" generated by this assistant are read out loud if my specific bluetooth headset is detected (can be generalized)
